# SignalK paths

Extra information for (non standard) SignalK paths used in GOSK

## 1. Identifier

The regular expression part in a path is used to identify the function and location of equipment.

### 1.1 Function

If the function can be determined by the path itself, e.g. `/vessels/<RegExp>/tanks/fuel/<RegExp>` => `/vessels/<RegExp>/tanks/fuel/starboardAft`, the function is not included in the regular expression.

Used functions in GOSK are:

- `mainEngine`
- `generatorEngine`
- `bowThrusterEngine`
- `auxiliaryEngine`

### 1.2 Location

The location is not included in the path when there is only one instance of that equipment, e.g. `/vessels/<RegExp>/propulsion/<RegExp>` => `/vessels/<RegExp>/propulsion/mainEngine`.

If multiple instances of the same equipment exist then a location is added after the function, e.g. `/vessels/<RegExp>/propulsion/mainEnginePortAft` and `/vessels/<RegExp>/propulsion/mainEngineStarboardAft`. If multiple instances of the same equipment exist then a path without location must exist and should contain an aggregate value, e.g. `/vessels/<RegExp>/propulsion/mainEngine`.

#### 1.2.1 Port to starboard

Used locations in GOSK are:

- `port` (cannot be used together with `portInner` and `portOuter`)
- `portOuter`
- `portInner`
- `centerPort` (port of center, can be used with `port` or with `portInner` and `portOuter`)
- `center`
- `centerStarboard` (starboard of center, can be used with `starboard` or with `starboardInner` and `starboardOuter`)
- `starboardInner`
- `starboardOuter`
- `starboard` (cannot be used together with `starboardInner` and `starboardOuter`)

#### 1.2.2 Forward to aft

Used locations in GOSK are:

- `forward` (in front of the cargo area)
- `aft` (behind the cargo area)
- `<number>` (can be added to a position to clarify a position, lower numbers are closer to the front of the ship, higher numbers are closer to the aft of the ship, counting starts at 1)

#### 1.2.3 Combining locations

A complete location is the combination of the above written as camelCase. The combination starts with optional a 'port to starboard' location and then optional a 'forward to aft' location.

Valid examples are:

- `<empty string>` (used when for single instance or aggregate)
- `forward`
- `starboardInner`
- `portAft1`

### 1.3 Combining function and location

A complete identifier is a combination of a function and a location written in camelCase. If this combination would result in an `<empty string>` then the identifier becomes `total`.

Valid examples are:

- `total`
- `mainEngineStarboard`
- `portAft2`
- `starboard6`
- `5`

## 2. Paths for cargo
